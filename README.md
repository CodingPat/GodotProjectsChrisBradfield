1.CoinDash adaptations
- player is put back at the center of the screen at every new game
- spawning multiple obstacles at random position
- all sprites are fully displayed on the screen (detection of the edge of the screen is not based anymore on the center position of the area2d,
but on the extent of the collisionshape2d)
